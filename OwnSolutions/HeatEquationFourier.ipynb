    "A basic fact of nature is that heat flows from hot to cold, that is, from regions of high temper- ature to regions of low temperature. We give these words mathematical expression by stating that the rate of heat flow $\\vec{H}$ through a material is proportional to the gradient of the temperature $T$ across the material:\n",

    "where $C$ is the specific heat of the material and $\\rho$ is its density. Because energy is conserved, the rate of decrease in $Q$ with time must equal the amount of heat flowing out of the material. After this energy balance is struck and the divergence theorem applied, there results the heat equation:\n",

    "## Finite difference approach to solving the heat equation\n",
    "\n",
    "As we did with Laplace’s equation, the numerical solution is based on converting the differential equation to a finite-difference (\"difference\") equation. We discretize space and time on a lattice and solve for solutions on the lattice sites. The horizontal nodes with white centers correspond to the known values of the temperature for the initial time, while the vertical white nodes correspond to the fixed temperature along the boundaries. If we also knew the temperature for times along the bottom row, then we could use a relaxation algorithm as we did for Laplace’s equation. However, with only the top row known, we shall end up with an algorithm that steps forward in time one row at a time, as in the children’s game leapfrog.\n",
    "\n",
    "As is often the case with PDEs, the algorithm is customized for the equation being solved and for the constraints imposed by the particular set of initial and boundary conditions. With only one row of times to start with, we use a forward-difference approximation for the time derivative of the temperature:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial T(x,t)}{\\partial t} \\simeq \\frac{ T(x, t+\\Delta t) - T(x,t) }{\\Delta t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we know the spatial variation of the temperature along the entire top row and the left and right sides, we are less constrained with the space derivative as with the time derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, as we did with the Laplace equation, we use the more accurate central-difference approximation for the space derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial^2 T(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} \\simeq \\frac{ T(x+\\Delta x, t) + T(x - \\Delta x,t) - 2 T(x,t)}{\\Delta x^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitution of these approximations into the original expression yields the heat difference equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{ T(x, t+\\Delta t) - T(x,t) }{\\Delta t} = \\frac{K}{C \\rho} \\frac{ T(x+\\Delta x, t) + T(x - \\Delta x,t) - 2 T(x,t)}{\\Delta x^2}\n",

    "We see that the temperature at space-time point $(i, j+1)$ is computed from the three temperature values at an earlier time $j$ and at adjacent space values $i \\pm 1, i$.

    "## Spectral analysis approach to solving PDEs\n",

    "An additional way to solve PDEs in an efficient way other than multigrid methods is by using spectral methods which are based on expressing the solution as a Fourier series. \n",
    "\n",
