# PHYS250 assignment 1: random numbers

Use the Jupyter notebook on random numbers as a guide for writing your own tests of various random number generators, seeds, and tests of correlations between multiple random numbers.

1. Quantitatively evaluate the degree to which the purportedly random numbers generated by the internal `numpy` RNG are actually random by evaluating the full chi-squared distribution.
1. Test at least 2 additional random number generators by either creating your own (e.g. linear congruential generators such as the IBM one discussed in class), or using other libraries in python (e.g. `rng = random.SystemRandom()`). 
1. Evaluate the effect of using different seeds: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.seed.html#numpy.random.seed 
1. Much like our `sum` example above, try to evaluate the correlation between two and three different random numbers. A suggestion for doing this is to create 2D and 3D graphs and evaluate the correlations that way. You are expected to try this, especially if you already know some programming.
